## Summary
Project root cleaned and test/diagnostic utilities moved under `tools/tests/` to reduce production surface clutter. `.gitignore` refined to prepare for Next.js migration and preserve essential data file `data/fruugo.csv`.

## Changes
- Moved diagnostic & test HTML files to `tools/tests/`:
  - `comprehensive-validation.html`
  - `diagnostic-icons.html`
  - `test-dropdown-carets.html`
  - `test-social-icons.html`
  - `quick-fix-test.html`
  - `final-test.html`
  - `test-auto-year.html`
- Moved `sitemap.xml.backup` to `backup/`.
- Updated `.gitignore` to:
  - Track `data/`, `backup/`, `temp/` directories explicitly
  - Keep `data/fruugo.csv` versioned
  - Add future Next.js exclusions (`.next/`, `.vercel/`)

## Integrity Notes
No production HTML (e.g., `index.html`, product & legal pages) modified.
No CSS/JS assets altered.
All moved files are non-critical diagnostics.

## Next Steps
- Create a `next/` branch for framework migration.
- Incrementally port pages to Next.js `app/` or `pages/` directory.
- Introduce componentization (layout, navbar, footer, product cards).
